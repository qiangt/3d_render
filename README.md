# 3d_render
simple 3D render codes. 

I am following the youtube video from Coder Space at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_Hx0g5vFko
It has a corresponding github with the link given below. 

I believe the rotation/translation logic has some issues in the codes. The order of how to construct and apply the camera matrix still has some issues.
